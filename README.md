# Salesmate Sales Call Bulk Download Automation

This project is created to automate rather boring and time-consuming recurring task of downloading sales calls from Salesmate in bulk. The reason that this project was written in Java is to practice Java for a programming subject I'm taking in school.

1. Once you've keyed in all the neccessary info, a browser window will pop up.
2. You'll be logged in to Salesmate automatically based on the credentials you provided.
3. The script will go through the list of the calls and save the call logs that meet the requirements set.
4. Once the script has reached the end of the call logs, the qualified sales calls will be downloaded and saved to the selected folder with this naming convention: DATE-DURATION-NAME-SALES PERSON'S NAME
